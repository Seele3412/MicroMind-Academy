                    Practical tips: Textbooks are often the gateway to a subject, so do thd economics. But <mark>active engagement</mark> is key to truly learning. Rather than reading passively or simply highlighting, focus on <mark>capturing key points</mark> by writing them down. This method helps you memorize important concepts and gives you a personalized study guide for revising later. Writing helps your brain remember better than skimming or highlighting, especially when faced with dense material. So when you are reading a textbook after downloading, remember: make each note count for better focus and retention!
