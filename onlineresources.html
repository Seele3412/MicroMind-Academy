                    Practical tips: Textbooks are often the gateway to a subject, and so is economics. But <mark>active engagement</mark> is key to truly learning. Instead of reading passively or simply highlighting, focus on <mark>capturing key points</mark> by writing them down. This method not only helps you memorize important concepts but also provides you with a personalized study guide for revising later. Writing engages your brain more effectively than skimming or highlighting, especially when faced with dense material. So, when you are reading a textbook after downloading it, remember: make each note count for better focus and retention!
