                <h2>Why are you worrying your note?</h2>
                    Let’s fast-forward to the end. Exams are approaching, and you have three weeks of intensive revision ahead. Where does it all start? With your notes. What will you be frantically reviewing the night before the exam? Your notes. And throughout your study sessions, <mark>what will you keep referring back to? Your notes.</mark> It's easy to think you'll remember a key point from a lecture for a few days or even a week. But after eight weeks of lectures, can you really recall what was said 22 minutes into your fourth microeconomics lecture? Chances are, you won’t. That’s why effective note-taking is crucial—not to capture every word, but to focus on the most important points.

                <h2>Different methods of note-taking in Economics</h2>
                <p>
                    Taking notes is more than just a habit; it's the backbone of your learning in economics. But let’s be real—it’s not always easy. You’re sitting in a fast-paced lecture or flipping through dense reading material, and trying to capture every critical point feels impossible. So, what’s the solution? Find a note-taking method that works for you, one that helps you stay organized, retain information, and make studying a little less daunting. Here are three powerful methods to try:
                    <h3>The Cornell Method</h3>
                    Imagine your notebook page split into <mark>three zones</mark>. On the left, a slim column for <mark>prompts and questions</mark>. On the right, a wide column for <mark>notes</mark>. And at the bottom, space for a <mark>summary</mark>. That’s the Cornell Method in action. This layout helps you break down complex lectures or readings into <mark>manageable chunks</mark>, distill the key points, and reflect on what you’ve learned. It’s perfect for content-heavy topics because it keeps the essentials right at your fingertips, ready for review.
                    <h3>Outline Method</h3>
                    Think of the Outline Method as creating a <mark>roadmap</mark> of your lecture. Start with <mark>main headings, add subheadings</mark>, and then drill down with <mark>bullet points</mark>. This approach lets you see the structure of the material at a glance, with clear distinctions between big ideas and details. If your lecture has a <mark>logical flow</mark>, the Outline Method helps you follow along seamlessly, highlighting the main ideas and how they connect. It’s clean, it’s organized, and it’s ideal for lectures with a clear hierarchy.<br>

                    <h3>The Mapping Method</h3>
                    Sometimes economics is like <mark>a web of interlocking concept</mark>. That’s where the Mapping Method shines. Grab a pen and start drawing: circles for concepts, lines and arrows for connections. This method gives you a visual map of the relationships between ideas, making it easier to spot patterns and links. When you’re revising, the map acts as a visual aid, reminding you of how everything fits together. For lectures full of interconnected ideas, the Mapping Method brings clarity to the chaos.<br>
                    <IMG src="img_mindmap.png" alt="mindmap" width="400" height="400"><br>
                    Each method has its strengths. The key is to experiment and find which one helps you make sense of the material and stay engaged. Whether you choose Cornell, Outline, or Mapping, good notes will be your best study ally—keeping you organized, focused, and ready to tackle exams head-on.
                <h2>Digital option: Take notes without pen!</h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes, the flexibility and convenience of digital tools make them a great choice for taking notes. Apps like Evernote, OneNote, and Google Docs are more than just online notebooks—they’re tools that help you organize, save, and share information. You can type notes on your laptop or tablet, create mind maps with software like Mind Minster, or even work on notes together with classmates. Plus, with cloud storage, your notes are available anywhere, anytime, and on any device. Digital note-taking is ideal for students who prefer typing, need to organize lots of information, or are working on group projects.

                    With digital tools, taking notes becomes about making information easy to access and organize. Whether you’re creating a mind map, linking ideas, or tagging important points, this method helps you keep everything ready for quick review. Try digital note-taking if you want an easy, flexible way to keep your study materials at your fingertips!
