                    Basics of Microeconomics
                </header></h1>
                    As you want to learn Economics for your DP courses, there are serveral fundamental concepts in microeconomics is essential for anyone studying economics as DP course will generally require background knowledge for high school student. You can't go to war without weapon. This subpage dives into foundational ideas, helping you grasp how limited resources are allocated to satisfy society's endless needs and wants. It will the first stepping-stone for you to challenge, hope you can use them well!

            <h2>Fundamental Concepts in Economics</h2>
            <p><strong>Scarcity</strong> (稀缺性 / 希少性 / 희소성): Economics revolves around how limited resources are allocated to meet society's endless <strong>wants and needs (需求与愿望 / 需要と欲求 / 욕구와 필요).</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Trade-offs</strong> (权衡取舍 / トレードオフ / 상충 관계): Individuals and societies must constantly make choices, balancing between alternatives for production and consumption.</p>
            <p><strong>Opportunity Cost</strong> (机会成本 / 機会費用 / 기회 비용): Opportunity cost represents what is sacrificed when a choice is made; essentially, "the opportunity lost."</p>
            <h2>Scarcity</h2>
            <p>Scarcity arises because <strong>factors of production (生产要素 / 生産要素 / 생산 요소)</strong> are finite, but human wants are infinite.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What to produce?</li>
                <li>How to produce?</li>
                <li>For whom to produce?</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Examples of Scarcity:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Scarce Goods</strong> (稀缺商品 / 希少商品 / 희소 상품): diamonds, apartments, drinking water.</li>
                <li><strong>Non-Scarce Goods</strong> (非稀缺商品 / 非希少商品 / 희소하지 않은 상품): air, saltwater, love.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Factors of Production</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Land</strong> (土地 / 土地 / 토지): Natural resources like soil, minerals, and water.</li>
                <li><strong>Labor</strong> (劳动力 / 労働力 / 노동): Human work, both physical and mental.</li>
                <li><strong>Capital</strong> (资本 / 資本 / 자본): Tools and technology used in production.</li>
                <li><strong>Entrepreneurship</strong> (企业家精神 / 企業家精神 / 기업가 정신): Innovation and creativity in production.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>The Basic Economic Problem</h2>
            <p>With limited resources and unlimited human wants, every economy must address three questions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What should be produced?</li>
                <li>How should it be produced? (labor-intensive vs. capital-intensive methods)</li>
                <li>For whom should it be produced? (distribution of goods and services)</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Economic Systems</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Free Market System</strong> (自由市场系统 / 自由市場システム / 자유 시장 시스템): Minimal government control, driven by supply and demand.</li>
                <li><strong>Command System</strong> (指令性系统 / 計画経済システム / 명령 경제 시스템): Government controls production and allocation to promote equality.</li>
                <li><strong>Mixed System</strong> (混合经济系统 / 混合経済システム / 혼합 경제 시스템): Combines free-market and command elements, common in most modern economies.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2><mark>
                The Production Possibilities Curve (PPC)
            </h2></mark>
            <p>The PPC represents the trade-offs involved in using limited resources or time.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Sarah has 10 hours of free time daily that she can use for either "work" or "play".</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The opportunity cost of one hour of work is one hour of play.</li>
                <li>Moving from 3 hours to 7 hours of work means giving up 4 hours of play.</li>
                <li>Sarah cannot spend all 10 hours on both work and play; she must make choices.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The PPC model is a tool to illustrate the economic decisions faced by individuals, companies, or nations. Let's use one example to understand this better.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Example:</strong> Italy’s Production Possibilities:
                <ul>
                    <li>Italy can produce either 7.5 million pizzas or 750 robots.</li>
                    <li>Italy cannot produce both at full capacity, thus facing a trade-off in resource use.</li>
                    <li>Which means Italy cannot product 7.5 m pizzas AND 750 robots</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
